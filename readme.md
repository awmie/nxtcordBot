# Tishmish 
### (personal project ‚Ä¢ not for production)
#### Premium Discord -music bot-
  - youtube, spotify playlist support 
  - hd sound (use headphones)
  - better clarity on pc
  - dolby atmos 
### Introducing new spotify integration with our Tishmish
  - command : **,sp**
  - use : ,sp < spotify playlist/album link >
  - function : plays the provided spotify playlist (adds dynamically to the queue)
#### how to start this bot: 
- type **,help** command to get started
- it will show a list of commands
- type ,help < any command name > for more info on that command
- which will include member and **tm** commands

##### what are tm commands
  - this is created show only chosen members by owner or admin can use those specific commands
  - now users having **'tm'** role will be able to access the **tm commands** 
  - tm role can be configured by server's **owner** and **admins**

there are some issues but will be fixed soon..
for better quality use headphones and your internet connectivity also matters..

### warning 
- do not directly disconnect the bot from the channel üëâüèº [here's the issue](https://github.com/awmie/tishmish/issues/1#issue-1432576605)
- instead u can directly leave the channel the bot will automatically disconnect.
- i m working on that direct disconnection problem (if someone tries to directly disconnect the bot)
    ‚Äì(**important**)‚Äì
- you should create a **'tm'** role in your server (don't forget to move the role below **tishmish** role) and you can assign the **tm** role to your friends for full accessibility of the bot.
- thanks
